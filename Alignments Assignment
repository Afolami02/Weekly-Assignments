My codes are written below for the alignments/mapping reference to a reads class below with explanations where necessary
conda install entrez-direct (to re-install e-utilities in my interphase)
mkdir mapping on the in-class-assignments directory, followed by cd .. mapping
gdown.pl https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PWWO5wVRRThLBXXEZjyWZHIb9udVcnCS/edit C.ferri.R1.fastq (use gdown.pl function to download the paired raw reads)
gdown.pl https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mZFvpSIctuBihkOlQX9vhrkxng3cRmvK/edit C.ferri.R2.fastq (use gdown.pl function to download the paired raw reads)
gdown.pl https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uoXQZeaismPEFe_rJjrkRdntDI0vBUNL/edit C.hydro_reference.fasta ( get the reference C.hyfro sequence from NCBI database)
bowtie2-build C.hydro_reference.fasta C.hydro (to index the reference sequence in C.hydro_reference.fasta)
bowtie2 -x C.hydro -1 C.ferri.R1.fastq -2 C.ferri.R2.fastq -S C.ferri.sam (to map the index reference into the raw sequencing data reads)
Head C.ferri.sam to check the information of the new alignment file
grep -c "SRR" C.ferri.sam to count the number of paired alignment reads made (the number of paired alignments read are 20,000)
The percentage of mapped reads to reference genome was 96.25% while percentage of non-mapped reads was 3.74%
