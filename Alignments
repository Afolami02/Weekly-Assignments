My codes are written below for the alignments/mapping reference to a reads class below with explanations where necessary
conda install entrez-direct (to re-install e-utilities in my interphase)
mkdir mapping on the in-class-assignments directory, followed by cd .. mapping
gdown.pl https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PWWO5wVRRThLBXXEZjyWZHIb9udVcnCS/edit C.ferri.R1.fastq (use gdown.pl function to download the paired raw reads)
gdown.pl https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mZFvpSIctuBihkOlQX9vhrkxng3cRmvK/edit C.ferri.R2.fastq (use gdown.pl function to download the paired raw reads)
gdown.pl https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uoXQZeaismPEFe_rJjrkRdntDI0vBUNL/edit C.hydro_reference.fasta ( get the reference C.hydro sequence from NCBI database)
fastqc C.ferri.R1.fastq and fastqc C.ferri.R2.fastq to perform quality assessment of the two test read sequences 
(The R1 and R2 reads of the C.ferri needed no trimming since they had zero (0)poor sequences in their respective fastqc files and the got good phred scores)
cutadapt -q 20,20 -a CTGTCTCTTATACACATCTCCGAGCCCACGAGAC -A CTGTCTCTTATACACATCTGACGCTGCCGACGA -m 50 --max-n 0 -o C.ferri.R1.cutadapt.fastq -p C.ferri.R2.cutadapt.fastq C.ferri.R2.fastq C.ferri.R2.fastq
(This will cut adaptors of the forward (R1) and reverse (R2) reads of C.ferri fastq data obtained)
In the forward read (C.ferri.R1.fastq), the total reads filtered after adaptor trimming was 96.1% while for the reverse read (C.ferr1.R1.fastq) the value was 95.0%
Also, only 4.2% of the forward and reverse reads contained adaptors for each file. 
bowtie2-build C.hydro_reference.fasta C.hydro (to index the reference sequence in C.hydro_reference.fasta)
bowtie2 -x C.hydro -1 C.ferri.R1.fastq -2 C.ferri.R2.fastq -S C.ferri.sam (to map the index reference into the raw sequencing data reads)
Head C.ferri.sam to check the information of the new alignment file
grep -c "SRR" C.ferri.sam to count the number of paired alignment reads made (the number of paired alignments read are 20,000)
The percentage of mapped reads to reference genome was 74.52% while percentage of non-mapped reads was 26.48%.
